This project is provided for PURELY EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. I take absolutely
zero responsibility for any misuse of this project, and condemn any use other
than education, and testing of very crafted environments. Use of this software
on any system not owned by you is entirely illegal, and even use on systems you
own can still be illegal under certain circumstances. This project is being
released to be read only. I do not condone running of this software at all,
and no support will be provided. Steps have been taken to avoid abuse, such as
stripping out minor parts of code, which are not a main component, but
nessesary for malicious use, and submitting samples to AV systems prior to
release. If I become aware of, or suspect any abuse, I can and will take down
this project at anytime. You are responsible for you own actions and any
legal consequences they may incur.
